# Napkin Figures for Blog Posts

Use Napkin for conceptual figures: workflows, privacy/data-flow diagrams,
decision trees, comparison visuals, and abstract explainers. Do not use it to
fake product UI. If a post needs product screenshots and official/current
screenshots are not available, ask for real screenshots or app access.

Generated Napkin file URLs expire after 30 minutes, so every accepted figure
must be downloaded immediately and rehosted in the Supabase `blog` bucket under
`articles/<slug>/...`.

## Usage

Run through Infisical so the script can read `NAPKIN_API_TOKEN`,
`SUPABASE_URL`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`:

```bash
infisical run --silent \
  --env=prod \
  --projectId=87dad7b5-72a6-4791-9228-b3b86b169db1 \
  --path=/meetspace/web \
  -- pnpm --dir apps/web exec node scripts/napkin-to-supabase.mjs \
    --slug meeting-minutes-software \
    --filename meeting-minutes-workflow.png \
    --content-file /tmp/meeting-minutes-workflow.txt \
    --context "Meetspace blog figure for private, bot-free meeting notes" \
    --visual-query flowchart \
    --orientation horizontal \
    --width 1200
```

The script prints:

- the Napkin request ID
- the selected generated file metadata
- the Supabase storage path
- the public Supabase URL
- the `/api/assets/blog/...` media URL to use in MDX

## Defaults

- Format defaults from the filename extension.
- Style defaults to Napkin's Corporate Clean built-in style.
- Language defaults to `en-US`.
- Upload path is always `articles/<slug>/<filename>`.
- Uploads do not overwrite existing objects unless `--upsert` is passed.

## Prompt Shape

Keep `--content` or `--content-file` limited to the text that should appear in
the visual. Put editorial instructions, audience, and brand context in
`--context`.

Good content example:

```text
Meeting recording
Local transcription
AI summary
Human review
Published meeting minutes
```

Good context example:

```text
Create a clean horizontal workflow diagram for an Meetspace blog post. The figure
should explain a private, bot-free meeting minutes workflow for teams evaluating
meeting minutes software.
```
